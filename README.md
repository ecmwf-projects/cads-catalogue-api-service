# cads-catalogue-api-service

STAC based API service for the Climate & Atmosphere Data Store

## Running the API

```bash
catalogue_db_password=â€¦ \
    uvicorn cads_catalogue_api_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips "*" --log-level info --reload
```

## REST API description

Let say that WSGI service root is configured to serve the API at `http://localhost:8080/api/catalogue`.

The Swagger/OpenAPI documentation can be accessed at <http://localhost:8080/api/catalogue/api.html>.

To access the list of all datasets (STAC collections index):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/catalogue/collections | jq
```

To access a dataset by id (STAC collection):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/catalogue/collections/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means | jq
```

To obtain the thumbnail image of a dataset:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/catalogue/collections/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means | jq -r .assets.thumbnail.href
```

### Links

Many related information are obtained using hypermedia-like resources (as defined by the OGC standard itself). \
Every dataset provides a `links` array.

**Licenses** are provided using links with `rel="license"` (the first license is also found in the `license` field), as defined by the STAC Collection.

**Documentation** are provided using links with `rel=describedby"`. \
Only title and URL are provided for now.

**Form** is a single link with `rel=form"`.

**Constraints** is a single link with `rel=constraints"`.

## Workflow for developers/contributors

For best experience create a new conda environment (e.g. DEVELOP) with Python 3.12:

```bash
conda create -n DEVELOP -c conda-forge python=3.12
conda activate DEVELOP
```

Before pushing to GitHub, run the following commands:

1. Update conda environment: `make conda-env-update`
1. Install this package: `pip install -e . --no-deps`
1. Sync with the latest [template](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/cookiecutter-conda-package) (optional): `make template-update`
1. Run quality assurance checks: `make qa`
1. Run tests: `make unit-tests`
1. Run the static type checker: `make type-check`
1. Build the documentation (see [Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/)): `make docs-build`
